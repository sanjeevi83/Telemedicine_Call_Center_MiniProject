# Telemedicine_Call_Center_MiniProject
Mini project for performance modeling of a telemedicine call center.

# Telemedicine Call Center Performance Modeling

This mini project focuses on analyzing and modeling the performance of a Telemedicine Call Center system.
It studies doctor availability, patient waiting time, and call response rate  using simulated data.

# Files Included
Mini_Project_Report.docx  – Detailed explanation of the system, performance objectives, and data overview.  
sample_data.csv  – A sample dataset showing telemedicine call and consultation performance metrics.

# Description
This dataset represents simulated performance records from a telemedicine call center.  
It includes call start and end times, waiting times, doctor assignments, and consultation outcomes.  
The data will be used to identify bottlenecks and propose ways to reduce response delays and improve doctor utilization.
